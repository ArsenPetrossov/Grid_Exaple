the objective is to allow the player to place tiles on a level within a designated grid. The complete mechanics should look like this:

- When one of the tile select buttons is pressed, the corresponding tile should appear near and follow the mouse cursor.
- When the LKM is pressed, the tile should be placed on the grid cell that the mouse cursor is pointing at.
- A tile can only be placed on cells of the indicated grid, and only on cells on which another tile is not already placed.
- If a tile can be placed on a surface, it should be highlighted in green, if it cannot, it should be highlighted in red.
